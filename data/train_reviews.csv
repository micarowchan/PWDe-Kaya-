It is a ghost town. Few shops left like a Pure Gold supermarket.,0
This is indistinguishable from the SMs in other small towns.,1
"Never have white monster in the grocery store. ""We have it all for you!"" Is a lie. What else am I going to take with my SSRIs? Stupid.",0
"Nice place, delicious food",2
Okay.,1
"S-style Shopping Mall, but very pricey. Good variety of merchandise and fashion. Basically everything you need at a price! Friendly security and cater to your every need",2
One of the nicest SM I've ever visited. At their food court you can take a glimpse of Mayon,2
"New Mall, Cool! I like it",2
Has a lot of stores inside. Looks complete. Has a view of Mayon Volcano,2
"As usual, it's cold inside, but because there's a pandemic, there aren't too many people, there are also restaurants but not that many, just enough",1
Good for everyone,2
"The mall offers a diverse selection of stores, from popular retail brands to local shops, providing visitors with a wide range of shopping options. with the background of majestic Mayon volcano",2
Lacks a few more stores but still great place,1
"Like other SMs in the Philippines, this place is the first choice in shopping in terms of variety and reasonable prices. Toilets here ate the cleanest amongst malls in Legazpi City",2
Like all other sm..,1
"I only used their grocery here in LCC. They accept credit card payments and I also saw Gcash on the counter. They have accessible parking space and helpful attendants. A bit shabby looking compared to other Ayala Malls I’ve been to but thank you for the grocery store and quick, free parking to get emergency needs while visiting Legazpi City.",2
"Overall the place is good, there is a terminal to any point of Bicol",2
Huge mall with upscale stores. The best in Legazpi,2
"Perfect for Al Fresco dinning however, This Mall is almost empty now...only a handful mall tenants were left. How sad....",0
"Nice stores/boutique selections, issues with lower parking, upper parking too high but with majestic view (Mt. Mayon)",1
The only restroom available is on L2. 😵‍💫😵‍💫,0
"As the jingle goes... ""We got it all for you!"" Though small by usual SM standards, this branch managed to cram everything to address the needs and wants of their faithful shoppers. They even have one of the best Prestige lounge I have ever visited",2
"Security wise, it was unsafe. Security guards don't bother people entering mall and check their bags. Didn't even use a metal detector",0
Spacious and cold shopping place. You've got it all here,2
Kid-friendly place with lots of choices to dine,2
Superb mall with a supermarket on the ground floor for daily shopping,2
okay near Grand Terminal,2
Food Hall in sm city of Legazpi ❤️,2
nice and tidy place to shop and dine,2
"this is a much better place to make tambay as compared to ayala mall. one thing i dont like about this branch of SM is the cinema. Their cinemas are too small and sound quality is not that good. The movie doesnt even fit the entire screen of the cinema. If manonood kayo ng movies, always go for ayala mall",1
Just likr any typical SM mall,1
Accessible & convinient place to be . . .,2
"SM is really a nice place and so may food to choose in food court. Me and my friends only have a few issue if you are carrying a heavy lagguage because there is no baggage counter, when you deposit it in the baggage counter of grocery, the guard will ask you if you are going to make some groceries, if not, they will not allow you to deposit your baggage no matter how heavy it was",2
"It's very hard to find these puma shoes, hehehe. Anyways. This is a Typical SM Mall :)",2
Nice and clean,2
Nice shopping center,2
"The parking is not good, i feel dizzy driving going up. But the Mall is lovely.",1
"I was at SM Legazpi when I went to the province for a visit. SM Legazpi is clean, middle to high end shops, a lot of restaurants and cafe. I need to special mention the newly opened Macau Imperial Tea for their delicious milkteas",2
"During my time in Legazpi, I frequently visited SM Mall Legazpi as my only refuge during frequent power outages in the area. I often brought my 1-year-old son to Kidzoona to keep him occupied. However, our visits were often limited to the mall's operating hours, usually from opening until 5 or 6 PM, due to these power interruption. As an OFW living abroad, I am accustomed to certain levels of compassion and service extended to us parents carrying young children. When bathrooms are crowded, maintenance personnel in other places sometimes offer us the PWD restroom to accommodate our needs. Unfortunately, this was not the case at SM Mall Legazpi. In this particular instance, I needed to use the women's toilet near Kidzoona to change my baby's diaper. The queue was long, and no one offered to let us go ahead. When I approached the PWD restroom nearby, I was surprised to find it LOCKED! I then sought out a maintenance or janitorial staff member and politely asked if I could use the PWD toilet for my baby. His response was a firm 'no,' and I vividly remember the janitor—a short man with one blind eye—looking at me dismissively. This experience was deeply disappointing and disheartening. As a mother and an OFW, I believe that basic compassion and understanding should be extended to all visitors, especially mothers with young children. It is truly heartbreaking to be met with such indifference and inflexibility. I hope the management will consider training staff to be more humane and accommodating to the needs of all guests.",0
Expensive parking fee...everything is expensive in this establishment...but u can feel the spirit of x mass…,1
Its look goon outside😊 …,2
"A typical mall wherein you can dine, shop, go window shopping, watch cinema, etc. Comes with a free parking space for car users. Has restrooms for your poo and wee needs. Wheelchair friendly as it was accessible for wheelchair users. Still follows the COVID protocols set by the government.",2
"Local Market situated in the heart of Naga, must encouraged to patronize the produce of local seller as they are more fresh compare to supermarket",2
"The pinoy embassy in other cities' i would say, in case you might need something while travelling",2
There's nothing here.,0
"inasal in SM is a disgrace, the worst of all the Philippines, the first night they only had one food and gulaman, they said no tea, and then gave it to the customers who came after........ the second night with the place half empty they directed us to take away..... poor deluded people, we like all the people went elsewhere.......",0
Done meeting..,1
Poor housekeeping... Linens have hairs when we checked in. We needed to request to change it. Poor maintenance also as indoor unit of AC has dusts accumulation. Photos of beds in Loft in their website are deceiving it looked like one is queen size and the other is single but they are both single in actual. I even called them before I booked to confirm the bed sizes and they told me that one is queen and one is single. We were three to check in that's why I needed one queen and one single. So they dressed the sofa bed to accommodate the extra person which is not comfortable as the real bed. Elevator was defective. My senior citizens companion had to use the stair. On the other hand location is good. There are pasalubong stores at the ground floor restaurants and a chapel.,0
cozy and air-conditioned all throughout. Cinema experience was so-so,1
Got a lot of shops. Many selections of restaurants and fastfoods,2
Well recommended for family shopping and family fine dining....,2
Always a good place to shop!,2
"It's a fine place to dine, plenty of options. Shopping is ok",1
"Almost everything you need is available, good, clean ambience",2
Pro: Friendly Staff Con:The stores are short on the supplies you're looking for.,1
Same as any other Philippine SM... everything.. and the opposite of everything.. hypermarket,1
"Staffs were accommodating, approachable, and friendly. Wheelchair-accessible also. Customer service is great. From appliances to foods, they are almost complete with everything you need to an affordable price.",2
Nice mall. Many stores,2
Great mall. With a good verity of shops,2
👍👍👍😇👍👍👍 …,2
"It's basically a nice mall, but not everything you WANT is in here. Everything you NEED is in here. The mall's clean and well-maintained. They are also strict in implementing the covid safety protocol. The only downside is that it may get too crowded, so expect that there'll be limited parking space despite the humongous allotted parking space",1
"Very good. The food was yummy, everything was good. I like it.😊 …",2
Nice place,2
During this pandemic this stablishment is practicing the safety protocol,2
"No baggage counter, no enough cashiers in supermarket",0
Great place to shop but the parking lots a hazzle,0
The Bus Terminal back to Manila is located here. Better to Book Online as the counters here Close early,1
Sad state!,0
Not good,0
"Great place to shop if you're in Legaspi to shop. Only thing I'd say is that as a Westerner, it's a little bit overwhelming to have SO MANY staff popping up with ""hello sir!"" Seriously, like every three feet someone else is popping out, soon you've got 4 or 7 of them standing around you waiting on your beckon call. I'm not even exaggerating. It's not a criticism just culturally different than how I'm used to it in Canada. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. If you're looking to shop in Legaspi, this place has it all",2
Really for the masses,1
They have CBTL,2
"This is the famous sili ice cream (level 2) of bicol (the pink one). The Colonial Grill is the place where you can order it because they are the first to introduce the ice cream to the public in the bicol region.being able to consume this dessert up to the volcano level would prove how 'oragon' a person is. 'Oragon' which means brave is one word that describes a bicolano since they love to cook and eat spicy foods. This is the restos ultimate best seller and another one is the mantecado which is a pastillas flavored ice cream. The resto offers a variety of ice cream flavors that you will love to try like pili, kalamansi and others and believe me, you will love coz they really taste great. You will also enjoy the main dishes that they offer and they also offer plated meals at a very affordable price with unli tinapa or steamed rice and free drinks. You will be amazed that the free drinks has choices too. I've chosen the pink lemonade and to my surprise, it was so good cause it's not just the usual pink lemonade that one can usually order. It was made special because of the lychee flavor that was added to it. What more, the staff are very respectful and always smiling and accommodating. Collonial Grill has different branches in Legazpi City and the one that were visited is on Pacific Mall. They also have branches in Naga City...",2
"Parking at SM is annoying, it's okay, there's a fee, but who's there to assist you, right? There are guards, but they don't even show you where you can park, they don't do it.. and we saw a helmet fall, the guard didn't even put it away.. they just let it rain.",0
Surprise of all surprises it seems you have never left the Metro,1
Good for shopping and convenient for bills payment,2
Staff helped with wheelchair access,2
Very small parking area,0
When we visit the supermarket long que. Should have at least express lane for 2 to 3 times.,0
This is indistinguishable from the SMs in other small towns,1
A great but somewhat pricy mall where products sold are strictly divided between stores to avoid competition. Really a bit frustrating. Good aircon but extremely loud environment in the mall,1
Cleanliness is important in a Market place. Makes me wonder how this gets pass the authorities.,0
Lots of stores to choose from but there are few which are not that good. The food court should have things like partitions so people could still choose to have a semi-private talks while eating. Also there are empty spaces which could still be used for customers to dine in. Hoping to have more chairs on spaces with Mayon views.,1
"I love this mall... The ambience of a shopping mall, different food to choose from, clean restrooms, its two thumbs up... It has a convenient parking for different vehicle and pwd friendly because of access road for them... I enjoy visiting here…",2
Superb,2
This place is now dead. I mean it is no longer frequented by people and the area seems to be haunted. No life and no bars anymore. Totally one of the places that you should not see in Legazpi. You will really be disappointed.,0
Way too cold there,0
The shops and personel are excellent except their CR. It takes a while to fix it amd people and linkng up with long queue.,1
Pro:Friendly Staff Con:The stores are short on the supplies you're looking for.,1
"SM City Legazpi is a great place to unwind and spend quality time with your family. Even at work, you can feel and see the warmth and kindness of the people around SM City Legazpi. Come and visit to experience a wonderful time at SM City Legazpi!",2
Boring mall,0
It's good that all things are there and no need to hop in other place,2
When we visit the supermarket long que. Should have at least express lane for 2 to 3 times,0
Standard SM mall. Parking is hectic after 12 noon.,1
"The terminal is beautiful, right next to SM",2
"Just like any other SM, just smaller. But it has all the essential shops. Just without Krispy Kreme. :( Some shops didn't have their AC turned on",1
"As of today , it is the largest shopping mall here at the City. There were a lot of boutiques",2
Nice for a shopping tour,2
It's sad that I didn't experience the mall that much but It's a good mall and the only biggest mall in the whole Bicol region.So yeah I love this mall too,2
"If you find your self here while waiting for your bus across the street to manila, the have gerry's grill that serves good food and cold beer",2
Pinoy food exhibit from june 1 to 14 at sm legazpi,1
It's so beautiful 🥰 I even got lost because of the Red ribbon hahahaha! But it's beautiful ✨ …,2
"Very gorgeous indeed and very big our issue is always the Parking lol coz the paint pattern in the parking area going to the upper floors is tiny yellow-black stripes...too tiny for drivers so it's dizzying the parking is still winding around, really, increase the spacing of the pattern pleaseeeeee 😭😭😭 …",1
The pain of memories.,1
One of the best sm malls I've ever been through,2
Great movie experience,2
its nice and cool but i am looking for mobile microphone in the gadget section but they have it thats why i just rate 4star only,1
It's a good place to meet up and shoppe,2
The sm is big. But the jolibbee inside is still serving food one by one. Then the crew will pass it on to others when the follow up,1
Nice and bigger than SM Naga,2
Very enjoy,2
It's great and all but the mall can be quite confusing,1
"Not the biggest SM in the Philippines but its great. SM City Legazpi is a shopping mall owned and operated by SM Prime Holdings, the largest retail and mall operator in the Philippines. It is located along Imelda C. Roces Avenue corner Terminal Road, Barangay Bitano, Legazpi City, Albay. Get the best value that you deserve here at SM, they got it all for you!",2
"I love Sm City Legazpi one of the best Mall in Legazpi City Clean, affordable, fragrant, Employees very friendly, Approachable management everything is here in Sm City why would you go to another Mall if you win here Cold, Many Foods to choose from and of course Free WiFi The best is Sm City Legazpi among all Malls Because it is super clean and fragrant among all Malls I have been to 💯 relaxing and Recommended for all Bicolanos",2
The city's hub for transportation. The mall layout is so walkable and easy to navigate. You can expect what you need to find as it is like in any SM mall,2
Huge place good for shopping of whatever,2
Vikings and Ramen Nagi pleaseeee,1
number one to go to of legazpi thomasians!💛 …,2
Not worker friendly. No working space.,0
"Nothing's going on inside the mall since its nearly abandoned.Waste of space really,why do they built it is beyond me.Outside of the mall is another matter, the seascape and landscape is beautiful.",1
"Can find a lot of choices but a bit crowded in the morning. Fruit stands on the ground floor,plastic and disposables at the back area and wet market on the 1st floor with variety of meats and seafoods.",2
So messy,0
Good location and just beside the Pasalubong center. Most establishments that you can find within SMs in Metro Manila can also be found here,2
I can't hear where I need to see through electronics services and information,0
"SM, a place just relax, cool down, buy and shop",2
Just passed by from Cagsawa and wildlife park and took a ride here back to malilipot 👌 …,1
The mall is small with free stores to visit,1
It's so slow when you order... It's been almost 1 hour.,0
Decent size SM,2
You won't be bored here while waiting for the bus. It's comfortable,2
There are no BPI ATMs,0
its okay,1
Follows the health protocols imposed. Good job,2
"Nice place with good restaurants to dine with, bigger than sm naga city. Except car parking way open at rooftop. Getting into the car during rainy seasons will be a problem",1
Nice. 🙂,2
"Nice place to hang, shp, eat, etc. Basically a good SM where they have it all for you (obv not everything, but you get the point)",2
The money will run out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 my favorite there Kuya J halo2 …,2
Shopping is real,2
Very accessible to everyone.. the view of Mt. Mayon at the food court area is awesome..,2
Large shopping center. The largest in Albay province,2
THE shopping center! with a supermarket on the ground floor for daily shopping,2
"The place is ok. Rooms are very small and tight but comfortable. Filipino breakfast included. Location convenient to restaurants and town square celebrations. Staff was friendly. However, there are no lifts, so it is not accessible if you have disability or difficulty walking.",0
food court has a great view of Mayon Volcano. just in front of the central terminal,2
The mini zoo is nice....,2
It was great until she messed up my order but it's still good. Everything was on point except the pomelo salad. Big pass on my end.,1
"No elevator for upper floors, difficult access",0
One of the best. The management is very humanitarian. They allowed the use of their parking space during the height of Tisoy (Kamurri). Thanks also for Cong. Salceda for initiating the request,2
"Great place to relax, eat and shop with a majestic view of the Mayon Volcano. The mall has a cinema at the 3rd floor. Food hall is also located at the 3rd floor. Supermarket at the 1st floor.",2
The PWD parking lots are being used by non-PWDs and the security guards don't care. Okay SM,1
Complete shopping and dining experience,2
"No running water on the 5th floor function hall restrooms for 2 days seminar, not even a pail of water on the first day. Parking space was very limited. We were made to do with just 1 drinking water dispenser for almost 100 people and only 1 elevator.",0
Very elegant mall in Legazpi,2
"Some areas are accessible, others not",1
Huge place. It's cold,1
"The location is just perfect and very convenient. For those travelling from Naga, Tiwi, Tabaco, and Sorsogon, I would recommend dropping by at SM Legazpi",2
"It's not as complete as in Manila, but the basic needs are still there",1
The parking area at the top is nice 😍 …,2
"The bikolano sweets for pasalubong are pricey. If you have time, Daraga stalls are on the cheaper side",0
"Very accessible, has a variety of stuff to choose from and you'll never think of going as far as Manila",2
Mixed accessibility in different parts of building,1
Visit SM.Our Home located at 2nd floor in front of Zarks burger,1
Very good. Stalls are still intact and most of the stores are open even pandemic,2
Got everything 5/5,2
The PWD parking lots are being used by non-PWDs and the security guards don't care. Okay SM.,0
More shops & services & restaurant but so noisy wd loud music inside the mall its not for the ears & not conducive for shopping,0
Accessible restroom available and clean,2
I always love the view outside especially in the morning near starbucks store,2
accessible and relatively safe! only few minutes away from the domestic airport 😊 …,2
"Lots of variety inside in terms of shops for clothes, health, beauty, etc. Plenty of parking spaces. Accessible via public transport. Fair amount of food selection too.",2
Illogically planned parking garage. Many people drove wrong.,0
"Been there many times specially during ""health crisis times"". And it feels awesome. At present, parking is not free anymore. Valet is available at the ground floor for Ph100.00",1
Ok,1
We just been here 2days ago. I eat lunch with my mom here. Just across the terminal for buses and vans so it's very convenient accessibility,2
What do you expect it's SM with the same ambiance and smell,1
Improving but no water,1
"Its nice like sm in Mla. You can found all the different kinds of department store , restaurants , cinemas , & Grocery.",2
Super complete yung mga stores dito. I can buy all I want without going outside the town,2
He is wide.,2
"Pagranga kay Eba Art exhibit (March 26-April 8, 2023) Visit SM Legazpi today. Support local artists",2
"It's basically a nice mall, but not everything you WANT is in here. Everything you NEED is in here. The mall's clean and well-maintained. They are also strict in implementing the covid safety protocol. The only downside is that it may get too crowded, so expect that there'll be limited parking space despite the humongous allotted parking space.",2
Delicious food,2
"Although the sm advantage virtual card is not working ,the saleslady in helmet section are very polite good sales talk,even you dont to buy it,because this sales staff is approachable no choice and worth to buy it",1
...still one of the better malls,2
"Unfortunately, the restrooms aren't stocked with supplies the first time you visit. And that's from a super deluxe mall. Next time, bring an empty bottle and a tissue (in the trash, of course).",0
Already like a ghost town: abandoned and nothing worth going to.,0
The building is not very organized. The establishments are all over the place. What's nice about is that you're still allowed to dine in even if you're not yet fully vaxxed unlike in Manila,1
"The mall has everything you may need, it has great brands and great foods too. The food court is huge with a nice view of Mayon volcano, quite a view while eating with friends and family",2
"No elevator/escalator. They have one but its out of order apparently for 2 years now. You have to carry your luggage/stuff to the 3rd floor of the building. Its connected to the mall where you can use the mall's escalator going to the 2nd floor but from there you will have to use the stairs going to the hotel's lobby. Room is small with no windows and has a leaking aircon, and its not only in my room, some friends also had to request a room change due to same issue. Thin walls - I can hear people talking in the next rooms, left and right. If someone is playing their music or watching tv in the next room, you can hear it. The walls are so thin that you can actually talk to the person in the next room and have a conversation, seriously, my friends were doing that while we're staying there lol. They do have airport transfers but the van arrived to the hotel 5 minutes late to bring us to the airport. The accommodation apparently comes with a voucher for a free foot massage but the receptionist doesn't give it to you unless you ask for it, IF you're even aware about it.",0
So expensive food and not not quality food to eat at food court,0
"Mall is warm during the summer. Even on a weekday, the queue at the supermarket is long because there are not enough baggers and the cashiers are slow.",0
"The room looks like it has been renovated from an old hotel, but it was clean and comfortable. The staff were generally good and accommodating. However, we were disappointed with the lack of consideration regarding the food corkage policy. We explained that we had already ordered food for the adults, but the children preferred to eat Jollibee. We requested an exemption for the kids' meals, but the manager and the chef still insisted on charging corkage. It would have been appreciated if they showed a bit more flexibility, especially since it was just for the children.",1
Very giod place to shop while in legaspi,2
Affordable and accessible public market for all! With parking,2
Very nice view of the Mayon volcano!!!,2
It was okay not much to see here besides the great view. 1st colonial was good,1
Providing every need located in the heart of the city,2
They allow small child in the mall without facemask. Please safety first.,0
Not a good place to visit,0
"Spacious, well appointed spaces with affordable yet quality brands",2
"This is one of my favorite SM Mall branches - SM Aura and SM City Legazpi. It is located in the heart of the city, near to public transportations, other shopping malls, offices, etc. This is a very nice place, especially their Parking Area. Where you can take photos with the majestic Mayon Volcano at the background. ♥️💯 …",2
Nice mall,2
Serenity is there so I can have milk tea 😀 …,2
"adhering to and complying with the 'new normal'. business operations, although with restrictions, seem to be doing alright already. giving their support to ease the burden of the general public",2
"The bikolano sweets for pasalubong are pricey. If you have time, Daraga stalls are on the cheaper side.",0
"One ride access, big, lots of store inside the mall with 3 exit",2
"The food court is nice, spacious, and has many coffee shops",2
Let's have fun shopping at SM CITY LEGAZPI .....,2
Your basic needs are here as expected. Foodcourt has the most scenic SM food court,2
The UV Express terminal has been around for a long time.,1
Wheelchair ramp is narrow but usable,1
"Only has 1 pizza place and 1 ramen place currently. Diversity of shops is lacking. Ok for a first visit, but doesn't have much variety for an SM. Really clean though",1
Like any other sm malls,1
It's on okay mall. Serves all of a mall's intents and purposes. The place is relatively new (as of the time of this review) so everything looks clean and well-kept. A fair variety of shops as well,2
just like any other shoemart. The place has its regular tenants and the prices is almost the same with what we have in manila,1
"Everybody was courteous,friendly and helpful.",2
SM Legaspi is just across the Bus Terminal. So when you need anything before or after travel it so easy get what you wanted,2
Very nice place po good service po mam,2
All I can say is bring jacket if you will go shopping here in SM Legaspi. It is so cold here,1
"here are not many options, as a Muslim I could not find any product I was looking for",0
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year @ SM City Legazpi 😊🎄✨🎇🎆 …,2
"Plenty of food chains and restaurants to choose from. Always cool,spacious and with clean restrooms. Several movie houses for different movies",2
Best food court location. View of Mayon Volcano,2
A very convenient shopping mall right at the heart of the Legazpi City. With spacious parking abd follows safety standards by IATF,2
"SM feel like every SM City that you go to, nothing special but familiar and comfy. Ample parking space, convenient to go to because they house everything",2
Very giod place to shop while in legaspi.,2
"Few open counters for paying and so there was a buildup of people in the supermarket. Good selection of the more famous brands like Uniqlo, Starbucks, Mang Inasal etc.",1
Policies strictly implemented,2
"It's dirty, there's a lot of clutter. The trash can isn't organized.",0
When it's SM you have all the brands and things you want to buy. Atmosphere is perfect for family and couples as well..,2
The whole place is a mess.,0
not feeling happy inside,0
my stop over before going to Manila,1
"Very small supermarket but shops from. Manila can be found here like power mac, mi store etc. Unlike in SM Naga",1
No specialty items like you see in Farmer's market or Muntinlupa market... They don't even have natural rock salt and even spinach!,0
Most of the stores are cash only right now,1
Very convenient for shopping. The size is just enough and complete with all the items a shopper needs. What is lacking are waiting areas,2
"Nice,also has all the needs of people",2
Supermarket is chaotic and always crowded,0
Get to be there by to get it done right now and I don't have anything else can do for rent by owner in otherwise you want and we want me I words with words I don't want me and I will send my you need me and we are to,1
Came to relax after the convention,2
Always busy parking,0
"Traffic, no parking space.",0
Perfect. Down to the last single detail,2
"Doors too heavy, difficult to open",0
"We spent very little time here ‘coz I had to run some errands. We had our lunch at Kuya J Restaurant and we were very satisfied with the servings. Just a little bit of a walk because we were tired too. We went to the rooftop to see the Mayon but unfortunately, the weather was not good so we don't have any pictures of it from SM. Okay, we got a stuffed toy from the Arcade. 😅",2
It's so slow when you order... It's been almost 1 hour,0
Okay,1
This place is a ghost town now so if you are enjoying peace serenity you can visit here but the guards are really impolite so be very careful,1
Illogically planned parking garage. Many people drove wrong,0
SM city Legazpi i experienced the good air ventilation and services. They are quite entertaining and informative about the products or services you are searching,2
"Clean, nice view at food court with the mayon volcano",2
1st come 1sr serve for space parking lot…,1
Very cold mall haha charot. many food stalls .you can have many choices lels,2
The mall is great but going to the parking taking so much time. You would get stucked in the traffic.,0
"This SM is really MASSIVE, I had so much time to explore those high and low shopping centers, I don't mind if the bathrooms are really taper to it's hallways, and I hope this shopping mall doesn't fade away like those in other regions",2
Clean mall also with good ablutions. Many eating restaurants to chose from,2
the best mall you will find in Legaspi city with upper and lower parking for cars and bikes too. the usual restaurants and coffee shops youll find in all SM malls,2
Accessible and ample parking area.,2

"During my time in Legazpi, I frequently visited SM Mall Legazpi as my only refuge during frequent power outages in the area. I often brought my 1-year-old son to Kidzoona to keep him occupied.

As an OFW living abroad, I am accustomed to certain levels of compassion and service extended to us parents carrying young children. When bathrooms are crowded, maintenance personnel in other places sometimes offer us the PWD restroom to accommodate our needs. Unfortunately, this was not the case at SM Mall Legazpi.

When I approached the PWD restroom nearby, I was surprised to find it LOCKED!. I then sought out a maintenance or janitorial staff member and politely asked if I could use the PWD toilet for my baby. His response was a firm ""no,"" and I vividly remember the janitor—a short man with one blind eye—looking at me dismissively. This experience was deeply disappointing and disheartening. As a mother and an OFW, I believe that basic compassion and understanding should be extended to all visitors, especially mothers with young children. It is truly heartbreaking to be met with such indifference and inflexibility. I hope the management will consider training staff to be more humane and accommodating to the needs of all guests, regardless of circumstances.",0
"girl worked supermarket SM dont say hello to me i told 3 times hello she refuse say hello. i say to she without customer you nothing, if you don't want work give your work to another filipina. O",0
"If you are looking for modern contemporary furniture and decor, come to OurHome SM Legaspi. The staff is accommodating and they have great credit card offers",2
"Good shopping for groceries, casual and formal wear, home furnishings and appliances, pharmacy etc.",2
Very nice place to take your families good getaway from the farm house restaurants everywhere.....,2
This new shopping mall is very close to the heart of Albay...just across the public bus terminal going in different region,2
It's spacious and has a lot of stuff. The local restaurant on the second floor is delicious,2
"Same nice mall you will see everywhere, my favorite place to shop",2
"SM LEGAZPI, its ok for me not so crowded. Transport terminal just infront of intrance & exit. Where ever you go town here in Albay, very easy to travel.",2
Is SM CITY LEGAZPI the GREATEST Shopping Destination in thE Bicol,2
"The SM is fine, it's the newest and biggest, based on the complete experience, I won't leave to buy from anyone else",2
Dead town max,0
good place for recreations,2
Parking slots that are alloted to PWDs are being used by non PWDs. I hope the management should order the guards to be more strict in checking those who use the parking spaces for the PWDs.,0
No accessible restroom available,0
it's a great mall.one stop shop. very convenient. plus nearest mall to terminal,2
"If you want to take a commemorative photo with Mayon Volcano in the background, you can probably go to the Cagsawa Ruins or Daraga Church, but if you just want to see Mayon Volcano, you can get a good view from the food court on the 3rd floor. Even on cloudy days, you can wait in a cool spot until you can see the peak through the gaps in the clouds",2
The mess uhh😕,0
Good bargain for pasalubong. was able to buy shirt bags and wallet for a low price 50% discount,2
"Nice mall, but the parking system is the worst I've seen, they charge 20 pesos even there's no parking spaces inside, super crowded lots of cars and they blocked all parking spaces outside the mall, so is not worth it, go some where else to other malls.",0
"This place is a one-stop shop mall. It's huge and you can find almost everything you need...from bags,shoes, apparrel and every kind of outfit of any ocassion, they have also toys,hardwares & furnitures and appliances, movies and entertainments plus food stalls also banks & restaurants. It""s a cozy place to hang on with your family & friends",2
Almost every shop is now close. Dead place!,0
From the airport we go Sm Legaspi for our lunch then after we watch movies. For a while escaping and releasing negative energy by just strolling inside,2
Just a complete shopping outlet..,2
SM City Legazpi is a very nice place to visit. The place doesn't look as crowded as other Malls. It is very clean as well and the staff are accommodating when you have queries. The Restrooms are nice as well unlike the Mall in Naga City of the same name. Comparing it to the Mall in SM Naga I think it is quite better and more relaxed,2
I love brother J restaurant.and halo halo is delicious,2
"Lots of stores plus their food court has the best amazing view of Mayon Volcano. Friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable staff too. Nice parking area too",2
Parking with a beautiful view of Mayon…,2
Beautiful and convenient,2
Needs improvement.,0
"A simple but quite large park with playgrounds for children, some fountains, a basketball court with live gameplay as well as skateboard ramps.",1
Wide and has a lot of choices. #SirangLente #AimFor81,2
Great,2
"When you say SM ""we have it all for you"". Your one stop shop for all your shopping needs. During the Christmas and New year rush there was a surge of people entering the mall. Maybe because of the lifting of some restrictions of the COVID 19 health protocols such as the wearing of face shields and allowing children below 18 years old to enter the mall premises. Despite that, the managemrnt was able to cope with the mall goers as it still practice and implement the COVID 19 minimum health protocols such as wearing of face masks and the observance of the Social Distancing",2
"There are several malls in Legaspi, but this SM is the cleanest and most comfortable. The best thing about this SM is the food court. You can see the Mayon Volcano",2
"Security wise, it was unsafe. Security guards don't bother people entering mall and check their bags. Didn't even use a metal detector.",0
It looks old nowadays,0
Superb cake. But no breakfast meals only served meat viands,1
Very convenient for tourists who want to go shopping since it's located beside the Terminal and Lotus Blu Hotel is just a few steps away,2
It was nice and feels safe specially now we have covid-19,2
Can buy more food but i don't have enoug money,1
Friendly staff and beautiful people from Legazpi,2
"A Nagueno here, When I compare it to SM Naga, there are more food and clothes branches than SM Naga, the space is wider and you can really shop non-stop here hahaha (you'll spend money here haha). But I just suggest if there is a Map touch screen like in SM because sometimes you get lost when you're a tourist",2
This place sucks!!!,0
"Not too crowded mall, ayos lang to go around",2
"Completely different from all the other malls in the area. Vertical in nature and involves some walking up and down the stairs, because of this it can be tiring just looking around. Though from the amount of new stalls and establishments inside, it is refreshing to just roam the cramped halls.",2
Same structure in Manila,1
It's smaller than SM City of Naga but still a good place to have leisure visits. My co-worker and I enjoyed having foods inside,2
SM is a place to go ..,2
Because of pandemic..only adult person allowed at sm city legaspi,1
Good parking,2
"All's well except for one thing. Aromatic products should be away from food establishments. Whenever I walk past the ground floor, I can always smell the perfumes and such from a distance. It's too strong to handle that I can't stomach and choose not to inhale at all whenever we walk past that certain area. It was that bad.",0
"As usual you have amole of choices when it comes to eating out there, parking inside or outside is no problem",2
"Always traffic but has plenty of parking space, great deals, approachable guards and cashiers and a very cold place. Great restroom, always clean. It has different varieties of foods and drinks to choose from",2
Hello po good for you guys doing well and your family,2
Nice but pocketwhole maker🥴 know what I mean hahaha. …,0
"A public market in Legaspi City, where you, will find all your needs and everyday lifes.",2
The arcade is a bit small compared to other SM malls and there is no Karaoke booth in the arcade,0
Ramp is broken and unsafe,0
Cold,0
"New SM Mall opened last 2018. They have barious stalls, boutique's and Bars to choose from",2
They got it all for you. Amu knows the ninda. Just hand parking,1
"Once inside the mall is great, however parking is always a disaster and the small roads to it are jammed with tricycles, jeepneys, tour buses. It took me 45 minutes to go 2 blocks at 6pm",1
Incomplete items and incomplete stores... Too sad this pandemic makes it worse,0
"I had a very comfortable and nice experience with my friends and family, shopping, visiting and eating at the restaurants and watching the movies. There is also ample parking space plus it is just in front of the bus, van and jeepneys to anywhere you want to go. Easy to gather my friends and family in one place. Good choices for eating and shopping are there especially my faves Starbucks and Breadtalk which never fail to amaze me with their products. Spent one rainy day with my family and went home once the rain abated and my grand kids just totally enjoyed the experience. Just watch out for transpo schedules though. You might miss your ride if you dont have your own car",2
"It was my first day in Legazpi City, and first order of the day was to do some shopping for a birthday celebration. My friend and i went to SM City supermarket, and like all the other branches of SM you can almost find anything you need from groceries to appliances to ready-to-wear items. We had a breeze shopping! Nice ambience inside, Christmas is really in the air! 😊",2
"Mang Inasal here, doesnt serve soup. What's the point of eating here, if there is no soup?",0
"Has a panoramic view and photo platform of what else, you guessed it - the omni present Mt. Mayon 😉 …",2
"We leave the hotel at 3am in the morning, coffee and packed sandwiches and banana are served. Quiet place. Located near the town plaza.",1
Good shopping mall with plenty of food outlets and a food court overlooking mayon volcano,2
"This place has everything. Great variety of restaurants, shops and entertainment. Most importantly, though, it's air conditioned! My only problem is that sometimes it can be a little bit too crowded, especially on weekends. Still, though, great mall.",2
"After a grueling tour with the sweltering heat of May accompanying our little daughter in her day care school's field trip in Albay, entering this mall is a welcome respite!",2
"a place where you are at peace roaming around to buy a certain authentic products. nice parking lot at the back. and when you are hungry from afar, the delicious meals at the first floor welcomes your cravings. . the associatess are very welcoming accomodating. Wanna go back and enjoy my walks around",2
It is a good place to buy things and even unwind in the beautiful view of Mt. Mayon,2
Amazing 😮😮😮😮 This SM is now spacious and very modern. 😮😮😮😮 …,2
Excellent view of Mt Mayon. It is also a nice place to relax while shopping,2
"Great place to shop. In my opinion, it is currently the top mall in legazpi. You can find almost anything you need",2
"Looks like a ghost town, trash in the ocean, and The Bowling Center only have 8 lane.",0
"I had a lot of great experience here. It can be considered, for me, as a Manila Rate Mall compared to Naga’s several Malls",2
"Place is great, food is very enjoyable over the overlooking Mayon Volcano. However, the guards on the entrances still lacks of proper training on how to interact to customers, specially the guards outside the mall roving on the parking area.....",1
The security guard are not knowledgeable to the stores inside the mall.if you ask direction they don't know where to find the store..parang namamasyal din ang mga guard sa mall hahahaha,0
"Just in front of bus/van terminal, always a visit when in legazpi",2
A nice view from the parking lot.😍😍❤ …,2
"It's a very nice place, I liked it very much, we ate at KFC",2
Has a unique view of the majestic Mayon Volcano,2
Grocery still lack of few items,0
It,1
I don't like the system on the parking fee,0
"I don't appreciate it much yet, but it's okay.. there are many stores to go to... :)",1
Very convenient place,2
The shops and personel are excellent except their CR. It takes a while to fix it amd people and linkng up with long queue,1
"Within SM just near UV express Van. Very convenient for weary travellers. I think their menu is more than what Jollibee or Mc Do can offer. This restaurant has its roots here in Bicol region. Well lit, up to date decors and courteous staff. Definitely a must visit place in Bicol.",2
Good,2
My child enjoyed our visit here,2
"SM City Legazpi is an all in one store for your needs. You can choose from buying groceries, medicines, clothes and other accessories. You can also choose from different diner to eat once you feel hungry upon eating",2
"Beautiful, spacious and kudos to the staff. Their workers are very approachable and the building designs are also beautiful. 😇🙂💕 …",2
Its fine,1
What do you expect it's SM with the same ambiance and smell.,1
"This is the best time to shop for essentials. A lot of items are now discounted for as much as 50percent. And its not as crowded as before. If things normalize after 2022, we would not see the same discounts we have right now",2
Checking if stalls selling authentic Croc Slipper Sandals. Sadly no one. Less than 15 minutes walk around not strol from ground to 3rd floor,0
"All SMs are the same, but here there is a terminal, all the places to board are here. It's big and clean, there are cheap places to eat, you just have to choose so you don't spend a fortune",2
"During my time in Legazpi, I frequently visited SM Mall Legazpi as my only refuge during frequent power outages in the area. I often brought my 1-year-old son to Kidzoona to keep him occupied. However, our visits were often limited to the mall's operating hours, usually from opening until 5 or 6 PM, due to these power interruptions. As an OFW living abroad, I am accustomed to certain levels of compassion and service extended to us parents carrying young children. When bathrooms are crowded, maintenance personnel in other places sometimes offer us the PWD restroom to accommodate our needs. Unfortunately, this was not the case at SM Mall Legazpi. In this particular instance, I needed to use the women's toilet near Kidzoona to change my baby's diaper. The queue was long, and no one offered to let us go ahead. When I approached the PWD restroom nearby, I was surprised to find it LOCKED!. I then sought out a maintenance or janitorial staff member and politely asked if I could use the PWD toilet for my baby. His response was a firm ""no,"" and I vividly remember the janitor—a short man with one blind eye—looking at me dismissively. This experience was deeply disappointing and disheartening. As a mother and an OFW, I believe that basic compassion and understanding should be extended to all visitors, especially mothers with young children. It is truly heartbreaking to be met with such indifference and inflexibility. I hope the management will consider training staff to be more humane and accommodating to the needs of all guests, regardless of circumstances",0
awesome!,2
"It is our second time to stay here and it is a great place to stay when you want to splurge a little. The room comes with a buffet breakfast for two. Reception, The receptionist is focused more on checking you in and getting the job done than welcoming you. The good thing is check-in was a breeze. Welcome drinks were provided and the waiting area was comfortable. Rooms are very spacious and clean. The AC is working fine but I would prefer it to have a remote so I can adjust it while staying on the bed. TV is already a smart one yet you can still choose to watch local channels. A simple welcome greeting is displayed on the TV and you can also check hotel information through it and I find it convenient. Complete toiletries were provided. The bath and toilet are separate so there will be no waiting time and it keeps things private. Using the same design idea, the sink is also located outside the bathroom. There are small things they provide that I usually don't see in other hotels like the shoe cleaning kit and a weighing scale. Breakfast is plentiful with many choices. However, some items were missing compared to previous stays. The pool was nice and my daughter and niece enjoyed it, though the water was cold. The gym and sauna were impressive. Parking area was spacious. Location is convenient but not cramped. Only issue: keycards for 3 rooms did not work in the elevator at first.",1
Nice place and parking,2
Good to go.terminal is in the doorstep,2
I always enjoy looking over the selections at this store. I am happy and continue to return often,2
Great mall big and a lot of choices,2
🤮,0
Spacious parking space on the roof deck with a beautiful view of the Mayon Volcano,2
"easy to visit,many thing that you can buy,no need to go to manila,at sm legazpi larges parking,and quick parking also,you cant fell it hard,than other mall je je je,all and all it is my mall je je je",2
"Always crowded, nice place and good for shopping, etc, highly recommended 👌 …",2
Because it's SM Mall,1
"Designed to get you lost, along the way, you were able to purchase discounted tshirts, shoes, and appliances using credit card, when I was just there looking for a comfort room",1
"Lunch at Gerry's Grill: A reliable choice for classic Filipino comfort food. Expect hearty portions of sizzling sisig, grilled inihaw na baboy, and other staples in a casual, family-friendly setting. Good for a satisfying, no-fuss meal. Shopping at Uniqlo: The go-to for essential, quality basics. Found a great selection of their airism tees, lightweight jackets, and denim. Always a smooth, efficient shopping experience with well-organized displays. Verdict: A standard, successful mall trip. Great for a dependable lunch and efficient wardrobe shopping.",2
Very convenient shopping destination 😁 …,2
All of their staffs are always angry…,0
"Very nice experience with SM Legazpi. Variety of tenants. Complete from massage, nail shop, beauty salon to pamper yourself. Good food and bakery",2
"I don't get the CR situation. Constantly cleaning them yet they are all locked, no paper in stalls or at the sinks.",0
great mall!,2
No good building management and staff,0
"Its good to come and play here, Its because SM has Good Ambiance and Beautiful Places to go in here In short All things Are Instagramable 😊 …",2
The shops and restos were nice. I really like the feel. I would have given it 5 stars but I couldn't find WOF,1
Huge mall,2
Complete package from bank to everything you needed,2
"Very nice shopping center, highly recommended especially as a German",2
This mall is quite nice. I had a walk around here to kill some time. The food court up the top is the highlight with many foods. There's a fair few shops here with everything you may need.,2
"As a relatively new SM branch here in Bicol, I was really excited to visit the place. Surprisingly, this branch did not disappoint. They offer the typical mall kiosks and stalls (especially food and clothing). They also have dentists even on Sundays! Of course, I would love to see more stalls dedicated to pets. Haha!",2
"First of all, the place is huge and organized and accessible to all kinds of transportation. And you can see the perfect Mayon Volcano from behind",2
Beautiful Ambiance,2
Staff are nice. Clean place and right beside a big open parking. Also accessible to nice restos.,2
"One of the biggest mall worth visiting and shopping in Legaspi City, the place is located in front of the City bus and transportS terminal, a very convenient one stop shop",2
It's a small community mall but appreciate that there is one located in legazpi for tourists like me. There's a sense of familiarity. Though option is not as wide but main stores are there which is ok,1
One of the largest SM I've been through,2
Pure,2
"This hotel is literally trash. We had to wait for so freaking long just to get a room. While I'm writing this, we STILL don't have a room.",0
Piss poor idea of a beach. Great location but so polluted it's not safe to go into water! River leading into area has so much trash and human waste its sickning. Saw a dead half plucked chicken washed in from the sea.,0
Parking is always full,0
Shopping experience and a lot of fun for kids,2
"It is complete, safe and clean place. Accessible and can easily be find place",2
just a parking lot a bit too small for motorcycles. It seems like they just made it into a parking lot even though SM probably didn't go there. Just my observation hehe,1
Very wide place..,2
Has tons of shops and most bathroom stalls are clean,2
"Not a very shopping friendly mall. Since they are located near the Grand Terminal, they don't allow large bags in their supermarket's package counters after shopping from them. It's just disappointing they ""got it all for you"" except convenience.",0
"One of the best mall in legazpi city, where you can find some of the best stores",2
The mall is okay since Mayon overlooks the rooftop parking lot,2
"Good! I can see the beauty of Mayaon. But with so many people, the aircon is not felt. After all, it is already April and given that the weather is really hot...🙂 …",2
Mount Mayon already has an area..,1
wide parking space. sa taas nga lang haha,2
I live right next to it and love it. Only the parking area should have a car wash. Would be a great deal for cisitors to have the car clean while enjoying the mall,2
Hard to find parking space for your car when you go here by weekends,0
"You will appreciate the beautiful background (Mayon Volcano) and going to the mall’s parking is quite a great experience due to it’s unique location and design; is he mall’s ambience is great, with a great variety of stores/ brands",2
Majestic view at SM City Legazpi food court,2
Really good shopping centre. I recommend the SM shop specifically. Yeah there’s a good variety of shops. Food choice isn’t the best but has a a really cheap McDonald’s. Smart shop for phone sim is here also,2
"Almost everything you need is here. From family restaurants to clothing stores, you can definitely find it here",2
"Very gorgeous indeed and very big our issue is always the Parking lol coz the paint pattern in the parking area going to the upper floors is tiny yellow-black stripes...too tiny for drivers so it's dizzying the parking is still winding around, really, increase the spacing of the pattern pleaseeeeee 😭😭😭",1
Newest place in Legazpi City,1
Still keeping it clean like it is new. New stores have opened as well,2
Mall is well airconditioned. Security gurads are courteous. But department store personell attitudes sucks. No greetings and you can fell that they do not like to serve customers. Also movie theater staff are not helping customers to find repective sits for faster accomodation.,1
"Ugly mall, what. Seen one, seen them all. Mas maganda pa yung mga Manuela Starmalls.",0
"Room: Clean, but the bed is too high for toddlers. Wifi strong. Food: low quality, overpriced, missing ingredients, tough vegetables. Ambience: Not soundproof, noise from hallway and elevator can be heard. Service: Staff are nice and courteous. Overall pleasant stay.",0
I don't like the system on the parking fee.,0
It has a lot of stores! It has a looking-out window to see the majestic Mayon volcano,2
horrible parking scheme and traffic flow,0
It's a great place to shop. All that you need is inside this mall,2
Accessible and commuter-friendly,2
"Drop by from a vacation trip in Albay, so huge, and clean, best to go shopping with a lot of variety stores. Yiu can find best stores like Penshoppe, Oxygen, Regatta, For me and Memo, many more to choose from",2
"Nice place to shop..Parking ways needs improvement, difficult to manuever because of small alley on cornerning on the ground floor..",1
Sir Nanz and I just bought perfume,1
Nothing to see.. probably because we went there morning.. but the place was empty,0
eh. not enough seats for tired visitors. limited merchants,0
SM Legazpi solid is beautiful ❤️,2
"I am changing my review for this mall based on what I have experienced during the holidays. The cashier lines were so long in the department store that the management only provided one cashier for a counter that was built for three. Hey SM management, it's the holidays. Don't you think it's prudent to have more cashiers and less queue so the shppers can enjoy shopping. I wasted an hour just queuing up. SM always think that they are the best mall but I doubt it based on what I have seen.",0
The arcade is a bit small compared to other SM malls and there is no Karaoke booth in the arcade.,0
"It was fun. Almost everything you'd ever need is in there. Lots of store to choose from. Food , Clothes, Tools and many more. Kids will enjoy too. They got some entertainments such as indoor playgrounds, arcades and also theater",2
There are no BPI ATMs.,0
I'll be able to get in soon haha,1
It's okay but hard to find the things you want to buy,1
I wish there was a time zone....,0
The walls are paper thin. If you don't mind being kept awake all night by your neighbours then you'll be okay here. No fridge either. I travel a lot and that's a first for me. There are much better hotels for the price in Legazpi,0
Very spacious and clean. The sales staff are customer friendly and courteous. Restrooms are clean and well maintained. There are a lot of food outlets to go to. At the food court you will enjoy the spectacular view of the majestic Mayon Volcano. Parking is also great at the rooftop as one will have more scenic view of Mt.Mayon,2
Beautiful. Everything you need,2
Pathway smooth and easy for mobility devices,2
I took a 2x2 and 1x1 picture here XDDDD and then photocopy WAAHAHA,1
Lots of shop to go.you can find all the things you want buy ☺️,2
Shopping at SM legazpi was an amazing experience. There's a lot of food and different varieties that u can try,2
"The queue at counter number 2 is so slow, we've been in line for over an hour now. Please do something about this, people will be discouraged from going grocery shopping at SM when your service is this poor.",0
"This place has everything. Great variety of restaurants, shops and entertainment. Most importantly, though, it's air conditioned! My only problem is that sometimes it can be a little bit too crowded, especially on weekends. Still, though, great mall",2
"A good place to unwind, there's a lot of things to do here. Food, fun!. There's a lot of parking space too and well maintained",2
"Great place, free parking. And a one stop shop for your earthly body needs",2
"Very bad experience unavailable of water in the sink, how you wash your hand without water?",0
"Booked for 4, only 1 small coffee sachet, no water to drink, only 1 toilet paper, 2 towels. Staff are good but amenities are bad, deluxe room with 2 double beds, not enough room to move about.",0
poor,0
The mall is clean and not too confusing,2
"large mall, corteous staffs",2
One of the biggest malls in Bicol region. Never miss to eat in the food court with the beautiful view of majestic Mayon volcano. Well maintained and very clean,2
"A medium size mall but more to offer inside, food, clothes, tools, and theaters",2
One stop mall. Everything you need is here,2
"Not so big and not to small. It's a mall. If you're just doing window shopping, this is perfect for you",1
"Old and delapidated property. Visibly, there is no maintenance. Poor facilities. There are very few establishments offering services.",0
the place is clean and not that crowded. its not that huge compare to other SMs in metro manila but nice shops inside. The washrooms are neat and clean. Accessible to public transpo,2
great place to shop and chill,2
"They have plenty of parking space, up to their roofdeck, and they also have valet parking and services. Most of their stalls are already occupied, and there are paintings for sale on the 3rd floor near their roofdeck parking. Cyberzone staff here don't bother passersby.",2
It's so sleepy sitting in the food court hahahahaha,1
"During the MGCQ status because of covid 19 pandemic, the mall is open and essential services are offered to the clients",2
It was great until she messed up my order… but it’s still good. Everything was on point except the pomelo salad. Big pass on my end,1
It's just okay but need few improvement,1
Abandoned.,0
Never had a bad experience whilst shopping. I suggest more benches to sit on,2
Another place to enjoy the scenic view of the majestic Mayon Volcano while eating,2
"The parking is not good, i feel dizzy driving going up. But the Mall is lovely",1
"As much as I love having Starbucks coffee in the morning, SM Security guards are stupid! At 830 in the morning the Security guard does not want me to park my car by Starbucks, he wants me to Park inside and pay 20 pesos and walk from the parking to Starbucks since the mall is closed & opens at 10 am. Very inconvenient & very poor in customer service. I don't mind paying 20 pesos as a parking fee, but walking from the parking around SM to go to starbucks wherein there's plenty of parking spaces in front is stupid.",0
"Superb #SMLegazpi customer service! I went to return a defective item I bought last May 22, 2019 and the customer service representative immediately acknowledged my concern. One of the managers even went with me just to find a replacement product. I want to recognize Sir Gene and all #SMLegazpi staff for their service. Good job! :)",2
"They have unique food that can be seen on this like chili,pili ice cream,ulam etc..i call them their traditional food..",2
"Beatiful place. Accessible by rental banca that costs Php 2,500.00, carrying up to 10 passengers. Visit while not yet heavily developed and commercialized. Rental huts available. Buy food in Matnog public market to be cooked on Subic island",2
"Newest attraction of a mall in the area. Not that many mall rats yet. But what sets it apart is their vast food hall or foodcourt that boasts with a scenic view of majestic Mayon volcano while feeding on your choice of food. Although, I say they really lack variety of food choices, for now, which consumers can choose from. It is much better if they set-up local food tenants to offer local eats, you get a better feel of being an uragan.",2
"Very good vegetarian restaurant. The food is very good, there is a lot of choice. Very kind and welcoming staff!",2
They allow small child in the mall without facemask. Please safety first,0
Very nice shopping mall,2
Great views and accessibility wise 👏 👌🏻 …,2
What i like the most here is that PUV are just beside the mall. Readily accessible!,2
Up to level 4 from what i've remember. Busy place. A typical environment of a Mall,1
"Near @terminal,no hassle for shopping,games and groceries!",2
Accessible and good place to buy essentials,2
The child is still not allowed 🤣 …,0
More fun,2
"the place is good, the staff are ok, the room is ok, nice place to stay! tnx....",2
The service is terrible. They make their customers wait a lot,0
"All's well except for one thing. Aromatic products should be away from food establishments. Whenever I walk past the ground floor, I can always smell the perfumes and such from a distance. It's too strong to handle that I can't stomach and choose not to inhale at all whenever we walk past that certain area. It was that bad",0
"Their SM here is nice, it's also quite big 💛 …",2
Foods are amazing here,2
"SM City Legazpi is strategically located within the business district of the city. It is accessible to nearby establishments such as the PUV terminals, Ibalong Centrum, Hotels and restaurants. This place has a stunning view of Mayon Volcano in their food court",2
"It's been a few years since I last visited Legazpi. A megamall has opened here. Like any other regional city, it's bustling with people. Every time I go, I feel a vitality that is lacking in Japan today, and the incredible speed with which the country is growing",2
Parking is abundant. Security is strict. Comfort rooms are clean!,2
"Store hours stated online is til 9 pm. It was the deciding factor for me to travel from Albay to SM to print documents at 8:20 pm, but the store was closed when I arrived at 8:30 pm. Could have been better to update the store hours online",1
Great place and near the local terminal for you to depart and arrive from neighboring town and municipalities,2
Like any other sm malls.,1
"First, it was very confusing for me to get in the food court because of different things You have to a guide first for better assistance but is a good place to meet up with new people..",1
Beautiful in SM Ledaspi City,2
"Its nice like sm in Mla. You can found all the different kinds of department store , restaurants , cinemas , & Grocery",2
Why does Toca House exist in real life?,1
Vikings and Ramen Nagi pleaseeee.,1
"Hope it will not smell stinky and most of all, needs cleanliness.",0
This place is like Imago Kota Kinabalu.. a very beautiful place for chatting and shopping..,2
1st time going here and it was still raining 😂😂😂😂 …,1
Poor Customer service,0
The mall is great but going to the parking taking so much time. You would get stucked in the traffic,1
"Nice, big and clean. You can have chilli ice cream here at colonial",2
"Chicken garlic is my husband's best fav. Now that he's gone, I don't have anyone to eat with ;(",1
The mall needs to add new fastfood chains like burger king or pizza hut,1
"This place is hopeless. No development even after a decade since I came here, and actually turned worse. The entire area reeks like it has been abandoned by the government and society as a whole..",0
Thats the view from their foodcourt! Its just beside the bus and van terminals. It also just near metro or pacific mall. Usual sm mall with the stores but if you want to be some stuff i think you can find it cheaper in pacific mall but if you want to eat and relax then this is the place,1
It's nice to watch a movie here,2
The food court is over looking to mayon volcano,1
The service is terrible. They make their customers wait a lot.,0
"Love this place Excellent , they maintain cleanliness",2
Good service and good staff Fast clinig,2
Approachable staff and good quality products. Offers promos and discounts,2
And a good place to shopping,2
It takes too long to park. And driveways within their carpark are only big enough for small cars so bring your larger cars at your own risk.,0
lots of people show interest in new mall and took the opportunity to post something on their IGs and things to bought,2
"SM Legazpi is one of a kind convenient store/mall. It is good as SM Santa Rosa, SM Dasmarinas even SM North Edsa. I bought here different items like My rrj pants, penshoppe ( ripped jeans, perfume, hairwaxes and t-shirts), facial cream, school supplies and casual shopping of grocerries items for my family consumptions",2
