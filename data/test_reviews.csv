Needs maintenance badly,0
Entrance is okay but somewhat crowded,1
All of their staffs are always angry,0
You can get dizzy by driving at its car park,0
Elegant place,2
"Mall is warm during the summer. Even on a weekday, the queue at the supermarket is long because there are not enough baggers and the cashiers are slow",0
"Nice mall, but the parking system is the worst I've seen, they charge 20 pesos even there's no parking spaces inside, super crowded lots of cars and they blocked all parking spaces outside the mall, so is not worth it, go some where else to other malls",0
Typical sm in a remote city,1
SM Legazpi is my favorite mall in Albay! It's very big and offers a lot of shops and restaurants. The staff are also very decent and nice,2
Big establishment. Lots of stores. Well-stocked products,2
The pain of memories,0
"Spacious and secured parking, courteous employees and the view of Mt. Mayon at the roof parking is AMAZING",2
More shops please! I love the ambience and the view from their food court. Ground ans second level parking are always full so parking on the rooftop is inevitable,2
"Biggest mall in Bicol. It's beautiful. However, I hope more stores that aren't here in Bicol like Cinnabon, Tim Hortons and more will open",2
We went to watch Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness!,2
Located next to Ayala Mall. Great place to buy pasalubong. All sorts of sweets made of pili nuts. Bought from the mall and 100 cheaper in the market!,2
"It's okay, it's big and tidy, there are many shops and it's very accessible, especially since it's right next to the terminal.",2
the food is delicious,2
I love the view of Mt. Mayon from the food court of this mall but the event area is very small,1
The go to place to buy things you need. Great restaurants are also here to satisfy your hunger,2
Nice place to chill when stress. Lots of store so its convenient,2
I loved this place....near at the van station going to Daet...The Mt.Mayon Volcano can easily be seen by our eyes...You can easy buy foods and all items you need...Delicious foods and especial breads are always available…,2
"No baggage counter, no enough cashiers in supermarket.",0
1st Colonial's Sili Ice Cream in SM Legazpi is the best!,2
I hate malls!,0
A good place to buy stuff and good and quality service is rendered to people,2
"Mejo matao na lately kahit we're still in the midst of pandemic. Almost all restaurants and fastfoods are full in capacity esp late afternoon to evening. The mall is bright and almost have the things that you're looking for. Great supermarket. Mejo crowded nga lang, maybe coz it's holiday season.",1
The mall is nearest to the terminal. It closes at 10 pm so perfect for late night shopping. Also many food stalls and boutiques although quite expensive but quality wise okay. I like their food plaza most of all for it has a good voew of the Mayon Volcano. Xd,2
Congested because of the Manila girls who are already sour,0
Nice place to go shopping and food chains serve yummy foods,2
Ramp is wide and entrance is smooth,2
Needs improvement,0
Nice older mall with major retailers and electronics,2
Very nice,2
"The only good thing about this place is the view of Mayon Volcano, mall seems a bit small",1
"It's okay. Clean, for now. Guards and some salespeople aren't as courteous as in other malls",1
"Similar place to any SM you visit. It lacks some well known establishments like Tokyo Tokyo, Subway and other International Brands",1
"Elevator works perfectly, very convenient",2
"It's very hard to find these puma shoes, hehehe. Anyways.This is a Typical SM Mall :)",1
Good shopping mall. But aircon is too cold!,1
Nice place to shop. They are observing the safe shopping procedures during this pandemic…,2
"They were very accommodating, they explained the basics and all",2
"Most accessible place, its right in the heart of the city. Place where you can buy almost everything. When in the city dont forget to drop by",2
amazing and open for public welcome to anyone. So many things to buy almost every product in the country at the same time affordable,2
Location is the best,2
Feel at home always.. a place where you can buy anything you want,2
Nice,2
Spacious! You can see the Mt Mayon in the food court,2
"Ramp present but slippery, careful needed",1
Almost all stores you’d see in an SM Mall is also in this SM. My favorite place here is the glass-walled foodcourt with an outdoor balcony where you can enjoy a panoramic view of Mayon Volcano. It is very near the Legazpi Grand Central Terminal,2
"Stairs only, impossible for wheelchair users",0
"Big, clean, extremely cold aircon (bring a thin jacket). Service minded, pleasant employees. A lot of different shops and products to choose from. What REALLY brings this experience down, is the fact that all these SM malls insist on playing the ""super jolly, happy-happy ""SM super mall"" song"" every few minutes... At FULL BLAST! This is extremely annoying after hearing it for the N'th time! It becomes pure noise pollution... Please, at least reduce the volume at which the song is played? Update: Today, the amount of noise from ""music"" was pleasantly reduced",2
"A typical mall wherein you can dine, shop, go window shopping, watch cinema, etc. Comes with a free parking space for car users. Has restrooms for your poo and wee needs. Wheelchair friendly as it was accessible for wheelchair users. Still follows the COVID protocols set by the government",2
Table but with chairs,1
Thank you oppo legazpi for the new oppo reno14 5g,2
Visited SM Legazpi today and was impressed by the kind of shops thst are there as well as the cleanliness of the entire area. The mall has good stand-alone restaurants as well as food stalls in the Food Court,2
not maintained mall,0
"If you are go on shopping, you must visit the food court area where you can see the perfect shape of Mayon Volcano",2
Dead mall,0
I would love to visit SM Legazpi but it would cost me much in fair compared to the stuffs I'll buy there. How I wish we have SM here in Calbayog,1
"Escalators are down, elevators are down, stores are closing down. Only good thing about this place is the great view of the Mayon Volcano",0
"Good location, near to public transport terminals. Their SM cinema is good. Not sure how many seats but, in my experience in front seat, its quite comfortable compare to other cinema coz the screen is not that big. Its well designed that nearer seats especially on the corner wont feel uncofrotable watching. But i would love to watch at the last and middle. Love to visit more to see more of their stores",2
"1 star because It's not a safe place, Security guards doesn't do their jobs. Security camera is useless because they can't see anything from it. You can go to SM supermarket and put things in your bag and go out so easily without paying, even if there's 10 security guards there. They don't do their jobs they just keeps on flirting with each others. 1 star it is.",0
Biggest mall in sm,2
"I might be too blunt but my experience with SM Legazpi wasn't good. They don't have efficiency --from parking to department store cahier. Sobrang bagal, to the point that you waste your 1 hour in queues.",0
Stunning and very good ambience. My favorite mall and especially the view of Mayon at the rooftop,2
to love.,2
Biggest shopping mall in legazpi offering you what you need and wants,2
Big wide space. Not too crowded. A lot of shops and restaurants,2
"slippery, needs a lot of improvement. however, there are lots of products to choose from",1
It's Christmas-like at SM City Legazpi 💚❤️ …,2
Needs more maintenance.,0
It used to be a great place to hang out in the evenings with all the lights and stuff. 😔,0
"Nice view from the Mayon Volcano,but the van going to Donsol are too early to depart,and if you are from a far place like Donsol I suggest you ride the van early coz theres no more transportation after 8pm or even 7:30pm..",1
"The premium room for a couple is ok. Clean, with safety deposit box and toiletries. No lift, so not good for PWD and elders with stair difficulty. No credit/debit card payments allowed; cash or GCash only.",0
"It's fun if you bring your family/friends together , if you feel alone you can watch movies upstairs buy tickets. Have fun💕",2
THE the overall facility is nice however the parking is very minimal you could only find a decent parking spot on the second floor and the first floors they are always full at any given moment does some of the guards are a bit arrogant but not all of them somewhere even nice and very nice and would even apologize for every little inconvenience the mall has a lot of variety you can find it with any food there but the supermarket is not that very you can find all of the products that you are looking for and sometimes there are not properly stuff sometimes you have to wait weeks to have that particular product their advantage card is a nice touch though,1
Super!,2
SM mall legazpi is huge but a great place to shop for branded items. The Cinema is quite small compared to Bichara Cinema. Food court is spacious,2
Great place to shop but the parking lots a hazzle.,1
"This Mall is consistent with all the others, very clean and well kept. Security is well assured, it is easy to find a parking space. I know many SMs all over the Philippines but this one has a particularly infuriating feature. Indeed, apart from the Department Store where the staff is always courteous and knows how to behave, in almost all the stands the employees have their eyes riveted on their mobile phones and visibly speaking to them bothers them to the highest point, they barely look to be interested in your request it's stressful, embarrassing and particularly rude. Usually I give 5 stars but for this SM it will be 3 stars 😒",1
Very good,2
Modest when you know others,1
Place is pretty huge and parking was still okay amidst the crowd,2
Broken Air Con,0
"There are not many options, as a Muslim I could not find any product I was looking for.",0
"It's okay, it's big and tidy, there are many shops and it's very accessible, especially since it's right next to the terminal",2
Always a go-to-place by many. Good job SM!!,2
The aircondition is outstanding and also anything you can shop is here.Amazing establishment,2
Very nice shopping center had lots of restaurants and shops,2
"The mall has good ambiance, many food options to choose from, with great view of Mayon Volcano",2
Supermarket is chaotic and always crowded.,0
For a city like Legazpi this mall is beyond expectations,2
Legazpi Central Terminal just around the corner. Plus points for the great view of Mayon. All in all it is a great mall,2
Nice area. Great view of the Mayan volcano. Nice AC in the mall one of the coldest places in the Philippines I have been to,2
good experience,2
Nice. 🙂 …,2
"Visited resto local to Legazpi. 1st Colonial is here and other local resto's with famous dishes like pinangat, bicol express and laing",2
Not enough parking space,0
"Not that good. Its not a hotel, its a motel!",0
Hotel on 3rd floor is poorly maintained and managed.,0
Safe for parking and you can shop with at ease,2
"Don't even try to book on this hotel. The wedding that I attended finished 9pm. I am in need of a hotel since I don't want to drive late at night because I have poor vision. I browsed Google maps and found ninong's hotel, and I immediately booked online since the hotel name seems very familiar. When me and my girlfriend arrived the employees seems very nice and accommodating. I had no problem with the employees. But when we were going to the rooms the aisles smelled like animal pee, I just shoved it off and thought that maybe inside the room the pee smell wouldn't reach, but alas. The smell inside the room smells like animal pee and flood water as well and the room is very humid. I touched the blanket and it feels almost wet from the room humidity. We decided to transfer to another room but they said they have no available rooms other than the rooms on that floor (ground floor) which probably also smells like dog pee. We tried to get a refund but they said since we booked online we should request the refund online. We were so tired that day so We agreed and thought that we will just try to get the refund when we get inside another hotel. But when we try to refund online there is no refund or cancellation button. We tried to reach out their Facebook page and they said payment upon reservation is non refundable. 5 days before the reservation is allowed for refund and cancellation. So we can't refund because our booking is not in advance? The owner is greedy, what a shame. For those who say I'm just lying just try going and booking there and see and ""smell"" for yourself.",0
I love shopping because,1
You know this place,1
"New and large, close to the bus station, suitable for people waiting for the bus",2
"Located in the heart of the city, have parking spaces. Pool is nice. Accessible to shopping malls. Rooms: 5, Service: 5, Location: 5",2
Not as big as the SM malls in NCR; but most of the stores you usually see at SM malls can also be found here,1
"Lots of good restos, unlike SM in Naga City",2
"Good Air-conditioning (best cold spot is at the yogurt place on the 2nd flr), lack of free seating though, unless the foodcourt counts. But it's a good place for family, pets and friends. Bookstores, restaurants, and other shops seem well stocked enough to suit the needs for the location. Plenty of restrooms, but avoid not planning ahead when visiting on the 15th and 30th of the month (paydays) because of the surge in volume of visitors.",2
How cant get my money lost in my gcash acount,0
"Still needs improvement, however, location is awesome",1
"Still needs improvement, however, location is awesome.",1
The mall is spacious and clean. The guards are strictly implementing the protocols to be observed. Staffs are accomodating and nice (so far) hopefully that won't change. And my favorite place inside the mall this new year is the food hall. 👍 …,2
The Mayon Volcano as a nice backdrop at the food court area is definitely a creative integration of an urban structure. Nice live painting!,2
"Photos at 3rd level and image view of Mayon Volcano at the SM food court area, which happen to be packed in seating. It was a Sunday",1
No refund even though we didn't use the room and cancelled the booking at the hotel just because we booked at the website. We were told to cancel the booking at the website but there was no such button. Arrived at the hotel with a foul stench along the hallway and inside the room so we couldn't stay.,0
"Sm city has just opened in legazpi city. SM is also near to yeshano mall, ayala mall, and gaisano mall. It is on the heart of the city. It is very close to lotus blu hotel. They just opened last september 2018. And as part of sm holdings, we can Expect that the mall is big. Clean and shiny floors. Many restaurants to eat to. And a good place to shopping",2
"Same with any SM, a terminal to any direction of bicol as will as Masbate,then legaspi to Manila",1
Bigger mall and many stuff to choose from fine dine in restaurant and shopping center,2
Realy satisfied and the food has a good taste and delicious,2
"Weak air conditioning, dirty bathroom, no soap",0
Lost its former glory.,0
I have nothing to say,1
"Everybody was courteous,friendly and helpful",2
beautiful,2
"Store hours stated online is til 9 pm. It was the deciding factor for me to travel from Albay to SM to print documents at 8:20 pm, but the store was closed when I arrived at 8:30 pm. Could have been better to update the store hours online.",0
Has a nice view of Mayon Volcano,2
Its look goon outside😊,2
The mall has a very nice food court with its grand view of mayon volcano although they still have limited food choices to eat,1
Tom's World Arcade Awesome,2
"as usual it's like SM in Manila and the same goes for Alang, the goods are very expensive hehehehe 😂 …",1
